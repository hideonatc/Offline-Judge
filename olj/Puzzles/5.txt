(a) if it is the empty string
(b) if A and B are correct, AB is correct,
(c) if A is correct, rAR and lAL is correct.
Write a program that takes a sequence of strings of this type and check their correctness. Your
program can assume that the maximum string length is 128.
Input is a sequence of strings of parentheses 'rR' and 'lL', one string
